# Parklace. A parking application using firebase,pinia,express and vue 3. The main of the project was just to toy with existing technologies which i am familiar such as vue 3,firebase,pinia and monogDB, however originally the project was intended to be with redis however i had some issues with it so i had to go back to mongoDB.

The project is not very concerned on the UI Part,as that is something I'm going to work on when i make the modeling a bit better, least to say some of the code i wrote is bad, some are really bad, However considering the amount of hours i put into it. I'm looking forward to improve it.
